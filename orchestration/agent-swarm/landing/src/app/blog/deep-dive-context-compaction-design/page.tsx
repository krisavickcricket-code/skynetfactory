      {/* Intro */}
      <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Six months ago, our agents were drowning. Not in errors&mdash;in context. We were running
        web automation tasks that could last 45 minutes, execute 3,000+ tool calls, and accumulate
        conversation histories that would make a novelist weep. The obvious answer was bigger
        context windows. So we paid for 200K tokens. Then our completion rates <em>dropped</em>.
      </p>

      <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        This is the story of why that happened, and how we built a system that treats context
        compaction as a first-class primitive instead of a failure mode to avoid.
      </p>

      {/* The Counterintuitive Discovery */}
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-zinc-900 mt-12 mb-4">
        The Counterintuitive Discovery
      </h2>

      <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Here&rsquo;s the pattern that broke our assumptions. We had an agent tasked with competitive
        analysis: scrape pricing from 150 competitor websites, normalize the data, and generate
        a comparison report. With our previous architecture, we tried desperately to keep the
        full conversation history intact. Summaries, hierarchical memory, selective eviction&mdash;we
        tried it all. The agent would still drift. Around minute 30, it would start asking
        clarifying questions we&rsquo;d answered in minute 2. By minute 40, it would regenerate
        the full progress report from scratch, unaware we&rsquo;d already built one.
      </p>

      <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The fix came from a place of resignation. We couldn&rsquo;t prevent compaction, so we decided
        to make it happen <em>well</em>. We built a{" "}
        <code className="bg-zinc-100 px-1.5 py-0.5 rounded text-[13px] text-zinc-800">PreCompact</code>{" "}
        hook that fires immediately before the context window truncates. Here&rsquo;s what it actually does:
      </p>

      <CodeBlock>{`// From src/core/hooks/lifecycle.ts
export interface CompactionContext {
  taskId: string;
  originalGoal: string;
  currentProgress: ProgressSnapshot;
  toolCallCount: number;
  compactCount: number;  // How many times we've compacted
}

export async function executePreCompact(
  agent: AgentInstance,
  ctx: CompactionContext
): Promise<InjectedMessage[]> {
  // This runs synchronously before truncation
  const reminder = await buildGoalReminder(ctx);

  return [
    {
      role: 'system',
      content: \`=== CONTEXT SYNCHRONIZATION ===
Original task (\${ctx.compactCount + 1} compaction cycles elapsed):
\${ctx.originalGoal}

- Current focus: \${ctx.currentProgress.currentStep}
- Remaining: \${ctx.currentProgress.remainingSteps}
- Data collected: \${ctx.currentProgress.keyFindings.length} items

=== END SYNCHRONIZATION ===\`,
      metadata: { type: 'precompact_sync', compactIndex: ctx.compactCount }
    }
  ];
}

// The injection happens atomically with compaction
export class ContextManager {
  async compactIfNeeded(agentId: string): Promise<CompactionResult> {
    const currentTokens = await this.getTokenCount(agentId);
    const threshold = this.config.compactionThreshold; // typically 85% of max

    if (currentTokens < threshold) return { compacted: false };

    // CRITICAL: Fetch state BEFORE truncation
    const taskState = await this.fetchCurrentTaskState(agentId);
    const preCompactMessages = await executePreCompact(agentId, taskState);

    // Inject, then truncate everything before our sync message
    await this.injectMessages(agentId, preCompactMessages);
    const newHistory = await this.truncatePreservingTail(
      agentId, preCompactMessages.length
    );

    return {
      compacted: true,
      preCompactTokens: currentTokens,
      postCompactTokens: await this.getTokenCount(agentId),
      syncMessageCount: preCompactMessages.length
    };
  }
}`}</CodeBlock>

      <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The results were immediate and confusing. Tasks that previously failed at 67% completion
        (our old metric) suddenly started finishing. But here&rsquo;s what was strange: the agents weren&rsquo;t
        just surviving compaction. They were <em>snapping back to coherence</em>&mdash;like someone shaking
        you awake when you&rsquo;ve been staring blankly at a screen for too long.
      </p>

      <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        We realized we&rsquo;d accidentally built a synchronization checkpoint. Every compaction event
        became a forced re-read of the original goal and current progress. The agent couldn&rsquo;t drift
        for more than ~15 minutes (our compaction interval at current token rates) without getting
        yanked back to first principles.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-zinc-900 mt-12 mb-4">
        Why Bigger Context Windows Made Everything Worse
      </h2>

      <blockquote className="my-6 border-l-4 border-amber-500 pl-4 italic text-zinc-500">
        &ldquo;Context fatigue is real. With 200K tokens of accumulated conversation, our agents
        started behaving like someone trying to work while carrying a backpack full of every
        conversation they&rsquo;d ever had.&rdquo;
      </blockquote>

      <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        When we upgraded to 200K token windows, we expected linear improvement. Instead we got
        three pathologies that only manifested at scale:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <li>
          <strong className="text-zinc-800">Stale reference poisoning:</strong> The agent would cite tool outputs from
          call #47 in the context of call #2,400. The information was technically in the window,
          but it was 43 minutes and 2,353 tool calls stale. The agent couldn&rsquo;t distinguish recent
          from ancient.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong className="text-zinc-800">Work repetition:</strong> Without compaction forcing a progress review,
          agents would re-derive solutions they&rsquo;d already found. We saw pricing analysis agents
          regenerate comparison matrices three times in a single session, each time convinced
          they were doing it for the first time.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong className="text-zinc-800">Objective dissolution:</strong> The original goal&mdash;literally the first
          system message&mdash;would get buried under 800 lines of tool output. The agent would
          start improvising sub-tasks that felt related but didn&rsquo;t serve the actual objective.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The paradox: giving the agent more memory made it forget <em>what mattered</em>.
        Compaction, by brutally truncating everything except our injected synchronization
        message, forced the agent to carry only what was essential.
      </p>

      {/* What Doesn't Work: Summary-Based Memory */}
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-zinc-900 mt-12 mb-4">
        What Doesn&rsquo;t Work: Summary-Based Memory
      </h2>

      <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Before arriving at the PreCompact hook, we tried the obvious approach: incremental
        summarization. Every N tokens, summarize the conversation so far and replace the raw
        history with the summary. It sounds elegant. It was disastrous.
      </p>

      <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The problem is lossiness without intent. A summary of 10,000 tokens of tool output
        necessarily discards information. But which information? The summarizer (usually the
        same LLM) doesn&rsquo;t know what will be relevant downstream. We saw agents lose track of
        specific error codes because the summary deemed them &ldquo;implementation details.&rdquo; We
        saw agents repeat failed approaches because the summary said &ldquo;attempted X&rdquo; but not
        &ldquo;attempted X and it failed with error Y.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Summary-based memory is compression without a format. The PreCompact approach is
        different: it&rsquo;s lossy by design, but the <em>structure</em> of what survives is
        guaranteed. Original goal: preserved. Current progress: preserved. Key findings:
        preserved. Everything else? If it&rsquo;s important, it should be in external state, not
        floating in context history.

        The sweet spot is obvious: 1-2 compactions. These are tasks large enough to need

        often fail because they&rsquo;re actually too small&mdash;agents get undertasked and start
        inventing scope. Five-plus compaction tasks fail because the complexity exceeds
        what can be tracked across that many synchronization points.

        This data changed how we design tasks. Instead of asking &ldquo;can this fit in context?&rdquo;
        we ask &ldquo;will this complete in 2-3 compaction cycles?&rdquo; If the answer is no, we
        decompose. The context window becomes a design constraint, not a resource to maximize.

        compaction cycles.

        The Prediction
      </h2>

      <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Within 18 months, &ldquo;compaction-first&rdquo; agent design will be as standard as &ldquo;mobile-first&rdquo;
        web design was in 2015. Not because it&rsquo;s elegant&mdash;because the economics are inexorable.
      </p>

      <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Infinite context sounds like a solution until you do the math. At current rates,
        200K tokens costs roughly $1-2 per request. For an agent running continuously
        with 4K token output per step, that&rsquo;s $1-2 every 50 steps. A 3,000-step task
        (not unusual for our workloads) becomes $60-120 in context costs alone. And that&rsquo;s
        assuming you <em>want</em> all that context&mdash;which, as we&rsquo;ve shown, you don&rsquo;t.
      </p>

      <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The alternative: compact aggressively, store in external state (DynamoDB, Postgres,
        whatever&mdash;costs pennies per million operations), and pay for tokens you actually
        use. With 32K effective context and strategic compaction, the same 3,000-step
        task costs under $5.
      </p>

      <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The technical argument is simpler: agents work better when they&rsquo;re forced to
        re-synchronize periodically. The financial argument is overwhelming. The only
        reason we&rsquo;re not all designing this way is inertia&mdash;we&rsquo;re still thinking of context
        as memory to preserve rather than a working set to curate.

      <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        If you&rsquo;re building long-running agents, don&rsquo;t wait for your context limit to bite.
        Implement a PreCompact hook today. It costs nothing if you&rsquo;re not hitting limits
        yet, and it transforms a future emergency into a controlled synchronization point.

        The code above is real&mdash;it&rsquo;s running in production, handling tasks that run for
        hours and call thousands of tools. The patterns work because they acknowledge
        something fundamental: context windows aren&rsquo;t memory. They&rsquo;re attention. And
        attention, by nature, must be focused.
