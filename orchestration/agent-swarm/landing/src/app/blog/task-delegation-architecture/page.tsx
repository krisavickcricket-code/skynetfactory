      {/* Intro */}
      <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        If you&apos;re building a multi-agent system, task delegation is the first problem that
        becomes non-trivial. A single agent with a single task is straightforward. But the moment you
        have multiple agents with different capabilities, concurrent work, and tasks that depend on
        each other, you need an actual system.
      </p>
      <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-10">
        We&apos;ve been running Agent Swarm in production for over 90 days. Six agents. Over 3,000
        completed tasks. The delegation architecture has been rewritten twice. Here&apos;s what we
        landed on and why.
      </p>

      {/* Section 1: The Task Lifecycle */}
      <section className="mb-14">
        <div className="flex items-center gap-3 mb-6">
          <SectionIcon icon={Workflow} color="bg-amber-100 text-amber-700" />
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-zinc-900">The Task Lifecycle</h2>
        </div>

        <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Every piece of work in Agent Swarm flows through a state machine. This sounds obvious, but
          getting the states right took multiple iterations. Our first version had three states
          (pending, running, done). The current version has ten — but the core flow looks like this:
        </p>

        <MermaidDiagram
          chart={`stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> backlog
    backlog --> unassigned
    unassigned --> offered
    offered --> pending
    offered --> reviewing
    reviewing --> pending
    pending --> in_progress
    in_progress --> completed
    in_progress --> failed
    in_progress --> paused
    paused --> in_progress
    pending --> cancelled
    in_progress --> cancelled`}
        />

        <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          The key insight was separating <strong>assignment</strong> from{" "}
          <strong>execution</strong>. A task can be assigned to an agent (pending) but not yet
          started. This matters because agents run in Docker containers that poll for work — there is
          a real gap between &quot;this task is yours&quot; and &quot;the agent has picked it up.&quot;
        </p>

        <Callout>
          <strong>Lesson:</strong> If your agents are distributed processes, you need at least one
          state between &quot;assigned&quot; and &quot;running.&quot; Without it, you can&apos;t
          distinguish between an agent that hasn&apos;t started yet and one that crashed silently.
        </Callout>
      </section>

      {/* Section 2: Task Pools */}
      <section className="mb-14">
        <div className="flex items-center gap-3 mb-6">
          <SectionIcon icon={Layers} color="bg-blue-100 text-blue-700" />
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-zinc-900">Task Pools vs. Direct Assignment</h2>
        </div>

        <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          We support two delegation models, and you need both. Direct assignment is when the Lead
          agent knows exactly who should do the work: &quot;Picateclas, implement this PR.&quot; Task
          pools are when work is posted without a specific assignee and agents claim it.
        </p>

        <div className="space-y-4 mb-6">
          <div className="rounded-xl bg-zinc-50 border border-zinc-200 p-5">
            <div className="flex items-center gap-3 mb-2">
              <div className="w-2 h-2 rounded-full shrink-0 bg-blue-500" />
              <h3 className="text-[15px] font-semibold text-zinc-900">Direct Assignment</h3>
            </div>
            <p className="text-[14px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed pl-5">
              The Lead creates a task and assigns it to a specific agent by ID. The target
              agent&apos;s runner picks it up on next poll. Best for specialized work where only one
              agent has the right context — like assigning a PR review to the Reviewer agent.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="rounded-xl bg-zinc-50 border border-zinc-200 p-5">
            <div className="flex items-center gap-3 mb-2">

              <h3 className="text-[15px] font-semibold text-zinc-900">Task Pools</h3>
            </div>
            <p className="text-[14px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed pl-5">
              Tasks are created as &quot;unassigned&quot; with tags (e.g., implementation, research).
              Idle agents poll the pool, filter by their capabilities, and claim tasks. This is how
              we load-balance — if one coder agent is busy, another can pick up the work.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="rounded-xl bg-zinc-50 border border-zinc-200 p-5">
            <div className="flex items-center gap-3 mb-2">

              <h3 className="text-[15px] font-semibold text-zinc-900">Offer/Accept Pattern</h3>
            </div>
            <p className="text-[14px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed pl-5">
              A middle ground: the Lead offers a task to a specific agent, but the agent can reject it
              (e.g., if it lacks context or is overloaded). Rejected tasks go back to the pool or get
              re-offered. This prevents forcing work onto agents that would fail at it.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <Callout>
          <strong>Lesson:</strong> Start with direct assignment — it&apos;s simple and predictable.
          Add pools when you have more than 2-3 workers and want natural load balancing. Add
          offer/accept when you notice agents failing on tasks they shouldn&apos;t have been assigned.
        </Callout>

      {/* Section 3: Routing */}
      <section className="mb-14">
        <div className="flex items-center gap-3 mb-6">
          <SectionIcon icon={Route} color="bg-emerald-100 text-emerald-700" />
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-zinc-900">How the Lead Routes Work</h2>
        </div>

        <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          The Lead agent is itself an AI — it reads Slack messages, interprets intent, breaks down
          complex requests into sub-tasks, and decides who does what. This is both the most powerful
          and most fragile part of the system.
        </p>

        <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          The Lead has access to every agent&apos;s profile: their name, role description, current
          status, and task history. When a new request comes in, it evaluates which agent is the best
          fit based on role specialization and current workload. A bug fix goes to the coder. A PR
          review goes to the reviewer. A research question goes to the researcher.
        </p>

        <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          But the Lead also handles <strong>task decomposition</strong>. A Slack message like
          &quot;add a new blog post to the landing page&quot; becomes: (1) research the existing blog
          format, (2) write the post, (3) test the build, (4) create a PR. The Lead creates these as
          separate tasks with dependencies.
        </p>

        <Callout>
          <strong>Lesson:</strong> Your routing agent needs structured access to agent capabilities,
          not just names. We store each agent&apos;s role, specialization, and task history. Without this, the Lead agent guesses — and guesses wrong about 15% of the time.
        </Callout>
      </section>

      {/* Section 4: Dependencies */}
      <section className="mb-14">
        <div className="flex items-center gap-3 mb-6">
          <SectionIcon icon={GitBranch} color="bg-purple-100 text-purple-700" />
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-zinc-900">Task Dependencies</h2>
        </div>

        <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Real work has order. You can&apos;t review a PR that doesn&apos;t exist yet. You can&apos;t
          deploy code that hasn&apos;t been tested. Agent Swarm supports{" "}
          <code className="text-[13px] font-mono bg-zinc-100 px-1.5 py-0.5 rounded">dependsOn</code>{" "}
          — a list of task IDs that must complete before a task becomes eligible for execution.
        </p>

        <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          When a task&apos;s dependencies are all completed, it transitions from blocked to its normal
          lifecycle. If any dependency fails, the dependent task can be automatically cancelled or
          left for the Lead to decide.
        </p>

        <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          We also built <strong>Workflows</strong> on top of this — declarative DAGs of tasks with
          interpolation. A workflow definition says &quot;run task A, pass its output to task B, then
          fan out to tasks C and D in parallel.&quot; Workflows are how we handle recurring
          multi-step processes like daily content generation or scheduled health checks.
        </p>

}`}
        </CodeBlock>

        <Callout>
          <strong>Lesson:</strong> Dependencies are essential, but keep them shallow. Deep dependency
          chains (A → B → C → D → E) are fragile — one failure cascades. We aim for wide, shallow
          DAGs: fan out early, join late. Our most reliable workflows have 2-3 levels of depth, not
          5-6.

          wrong output or waste time researching. Providing structured context in the task description
          (repo, file paths, relevant PRs) cuts failure rates dramatically.

          Task delegation is the backbone of any multi-agent system. Get it wrong and your agents
          step on each other, starve for work, or fail silently. Get it right and you have a system
          that scales — add more agents, handle more work, without changing the architecture.
