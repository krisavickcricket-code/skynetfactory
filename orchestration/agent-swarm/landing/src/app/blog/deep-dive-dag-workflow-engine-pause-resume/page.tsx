      <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        We learned the hard way that sequential agent pipelines are a trap. You
        start with a simple chain: Researcher &rarr; Coder &rarr; Reviewer. It
        works. Then your product manager asks for parallel research while coding
        happens. You hack it with Promise.all(). Then you need conditional
        routing: skip the security review for internal tools. More hacks. Then an
        agent takes 45 minutes and your server restarts. You lose everything.
      </p>

      <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        This post is the architecture we wish we&apos;d found 18 months ago: a
        DAG-based workflow engine with explicit pause/resume semantics,
        convergence gates that don&apos;t deadlock, and crash recovery that
        actually works. No theoretical hand-waving &mdash; production TypeScript
        patterns you can adapt.

          Here&apos;s the classic deadlock: Node C depends on both A and B. But

          This pattern generalizes to complex convergence scenarios: multiple

          nested conditional branches. The invariant is simple: a node only waits
          for predecessors that were actually activated in this execution path.

            Port-aware tracking distinguishes &quot;A&rarr;C via success&quot;

          Conclusion: Build for the Graph, Not the Chain
        </h2>

        <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          If you&apos;re building multi-agent systems, you will eventually need
          DAG semantics. The question is whether you design for them upfront or
          retrofit them painfully. We chose poorly once; this architecture is our
          correction.
        </p>

        <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          The patterns here &mdash; async pause/resume, active-edge convergence,
          explicit inputs, port-based routing, crash recovery with idempotent
          memoization &mdash; aren&apos;t theoretical. They handle 12,000+ agent
          executions weekly in our production swarm, with median completion times
          under 15 minutes for complex 8-node workflows that include 45-minute
          research branches and human-in-the-loop gates.
        </p>

        <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          The Agent Swarm framework implements all of this. The core engine is
          ~2,400 lines of TypeScript. The patterns are portable to any stack. The
          lessons are universal: state machines beat long-running connections,
          explicit contracts beat implicit context, and surviving chaos is the
          only proof that your system works.
