      <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        We were burning $847/month on a single agent before breakfast. The fix?
        Change one number from 300 to 270. Same wake-ups per hour, same tasks
        completed, same user experience. The difference was whether
        Anthropic&rsquo;s prompt cache considered us &ldquo;warm&rdquo; or
        &ldquo;cold.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-zinc-900 mt-12 mb-4">
        The Five-Minute Bug Everyone Has
      </h2>

      <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Every agent that polls has a sleep interval. When we built our first
        long-running agent&mdash;the one that babysits PRs, checks CI status,
        and nudges stale reviews&mdash;we asked the obvious question: &ldquo;How
        often should it check?&rdquo; Five minutes felt reasonable. Long enough
        to not hammer APIs, short enough to feel responsive. We typed{" "}
        <code className="text-[13px] bg-zinc-100 px-1.5 py-0.5 rounded">
          await sleep(300 * 1000)
        </code>{" "}
        and moved on.
      </p>

      <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        What nobody told us: Anthropic&rsquo;s prompt cache holds your system
        prompt and conversation prefix for exactly five minutes from the last
        hit. Not &ldquo;about five minutes.&rdquo; Not &ldquo;five minutes give
        or take.&rdquo; Exactly five minutes, and then you fall off a cliff.
      </p>

      <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        A cache hit on input tokens costs roughly 10% of an uncached read. For
        our babysit-prs agent, that meant the difference between $0.0045 and
        $0.045 per resume. With ~12 wake-ups per hour, that&rsquo;s $0.054
        versus $0.54. Per hour. For one agent.

        field matters. Anthropic&rsquo;s model re-reads this every time it
        considers calling the tool. It re-derives the cache-aware logic fresh
        each wake-up. We&rsquo;ve watched traces where the agent explains:
        &ldquo;CI is still running, I should hot-loop at 240s to stay
        cached&rdquo; or &ldquo;No open PRs need attention, I&rsquo;ll idle at

        Cache-Aware Pacing: A New Design Dimension
      </h2>

      <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Once you internalize the cache cliff, polling stops being &ldquo;how
        often should I check?&rdquo; and becomes &ldquo;when does my cache
        window naturally expire and what should I do then?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Our agents now burst. When a build is running, they hot-loop at
        240&ndash;270s: &ldquo;Is it done? Is it done? Is it done?&rdquo; The
        cache stays warm, they&rsquo;re synchronized with the actual work. Once
        the build queues or completes, they drop immediately to 1800s or 3600s.
        Why pay to stay warm when there&rsquo;s nothing warm to stay for?
      </p>

      <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        This is genuinely new. Traditional cron jobs don&rsquo;t have context
        reload costs. A bash script polling every 5 minutes pays nothing for the
        interval. AI agents pay for every context window they load. The
        scheduling primitive is different.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-zinc-900 mt-12 mb-4">
        What Doesn&rsquo;t Work (And Why)
      </h2>

      <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        We tried the obvious fixes that seem like they should work. They
        didn&rsquo;t.
      </p>

      <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Jitter / randomized offsets:</strong> Adding &plusmn;30s random
        jitter to 300s sleep. Hypothesis: spread the herd, reduce peak load,
        maybe stay under the TTL. Reality: Anthropic&rsquo;s cache TTL is
        deterministic per conversation thread, not global. Jitter just made us
        miss unpredictably. Cost variance went up, average stayed bad.
      </p>

      <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Adaptive backoff:</strong> Start at 60s, double until we hit
        &ldquo;efficiency.&rdquo; Problem: the first wake after a long sleep
        pays full cost. If you back off past 270s, that first expensive wake
        happens every cycle. You&rsquo;re optimizing for the wrong metric (wakes
        per hour) instead of total cost.
      </p>

      <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Preemptive refresh:</strong> Wake at 240s, do nothing, sleep
        240s again to &ldquo;keep the cache alive.&rdquo; This doubles your
        wake-ups for marginal hit rate improvement. The math: 2 &times; $0.0045
        = $0.009, which beats 1 &times; $0.045, but loses to just doing real
        work at 270s and accepting occasional misses.
      </p>

        Across 24 agents running ~1,400 wake-ups per day, switching from uniform
        5-minute polling to cache-aware pacing:

        The agent-architecture rule generalizes: your scheduler must be aware of
        your provider&rsquo;s cache TTL. The natural human intuitions about
        polling intervals&mdash;5 minutes, 15 minutes, 1 hour&mdash;are
        uniformly wrong because they were designed for systems where context is
        free to reload.

[ ] grep -r "sleep.*300" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" --include="*.py"
[ ] grep -r "setTimeout.*300" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js"
[ ] grep -r "asyncio.sleep.*300" --include="*.py"
[ ] grep -r "time.sleep.*300" --include="*.py"

[ ] For each hit: is this an agent that loads a system prompt?
    If yes: is the sleep in [60,270] or [1200,inf]?
    If in (270,1200): you have the bug.

[ ] Check your Anthropic dashboard:
    Usage → Select model → Cached tokens vs. Uncached tokens
    If uncached >> cached for long-running agents: you have the bug.

[ ] Calculate your own optimal interval:
    cache_hit_cost = (system_prompt_tokens + prefix_tokens) * 0.0000003
    cache_miss_cost = (system_prompt_tokens + prefix_tokens) * 0.000003

    hourly_wakes = 3600 / sleep_seconds
    hourly_cost = hourly_wakes * cache_miss_cost  # worst case

    Find the sleep_seconds where hourly_cost breaks your budget.`}</CodeBlock>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-zinc-900 mt-8 mb-3">
        Does this apply to short-lived agents too?
      </h3>
      <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Cache-aware scheduling matters most for agents with wake-up loops.
        One-shot agents or those with human-in-the-loop triggers don&rsquo;t hit
        this&mdash;their context loads fresh each time regardless. Focus on
        polling agents first.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-zinc-900 mt-8 mb-3">
        What if my provider doesn&rsquo;t document their cache TTL?
      </h3>
      <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Measure it. Log the cache_hit_ratio from API responses across different
        sleep intervals. The cliff will show up in your data as a cost spike.
        Most providers fall in the 5&ndash;10 minute range.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-zinc-900 mt-8 mb-3">
        Can I just use a persistent connection to keep the cache alive?
      </h3>
      <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        No&mdash;the Anthropic cache is server-side, tied to your conversation
        ID, not your HTTP connection. Keeping a socket open doesn&rsquo;t extend
        the TTL. Only authenticated requests with the same cache_control blocks
        refresh it.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-zinc-900 mt-8 mb-3">
        How do I handle jitter when APIs rate-limit?
      </h3>
      <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Apply jitter to the work you do after waking, not to the sleep itself.
        Wake at 270s, check rate limit status, then add 0&ndash;30s random delay
        before calling the LLM. The cache TTL resets on the LLM call, not on
        wake.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-zinc-900 mt-8 mb-3">
        Is there any case where 300s is actually correct?
      </h3>
      <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Only if your agent wakes, does zero LLM work, and immediately sleeps
        again. In that case you&rsquo;re not paying for context anyway. But
        that&rsquo;s a strange agent architecture&mdash;most wake to reason,
        which loads context.
