        Three workers. Three SQLite databases. Three different beliefs about
        whether task #8472 was pending, in-progress, or complete.
      </p>

      <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        We shipped three contradictory pull requests to the same Linear issue
        before anyone noticed. Each worker had &ldquo;successfully&rdquo;
        updated its own local state. None of them had checked with each other.
      </p>

      <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        This is the story of why we banned database imports from our worker
        containers entirely&mdash;not with documentation, not with code review
        checklists, but with a 30-line bash script that runs in CI and fails the
        build if any worker tries to touch a database module.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-zinc-900 mt-12 mb-4">
        The Incident: When &ldquo;Fast Memory&rdquo; Becomes Distributed
        Corruption
      </h2>

      <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Our agent swarm architecture seemed sensible: an API server owns the
        task queue, workers pull tasks and execute them. But workers need
        context&mdash;previous actions, conversation history, cached
        embeddings. We added SQLite because &ldquo;it&rsquo;s just temporary
        state&rdquo; and &ldquo;direct SQL is faster than HTTP calls.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The pattern was everywhere in our codebase. Workers would:
      </p>

      <ul className="space-y-2 text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed pl-6 list-disc mb-6">
        <li>Fetch a task from the API</li>
        <li>
          Write{" "}
          <code>UPDATE tasks SET status = &lsquo;in_progress&rsquo;</code> to
          local SQLite
        </li>
        <li>
          Begin work, periodically syncing &ldquo;real&rdquo; progress back to
          the API
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        This worked fine with one worker. It worked fine with two. At three
        workers, the race conditions started.
      </p>

      <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Worker A pulled task #8472, wrote <code>in_progress</code> to its
        SQLite, started processing. Worker B, starting 400ms later, found the
        task still marked <code>pending</code> in the API (Worker A hadn&rsquo;t
        synced yet), pulled it, wrote <code>in_progress</code> to its own
        SQLite, and started processing. Worker C did the same.
      </p>

      <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Three LLM inference sessions. Three conflicting code suggestions. Three
        PRs opened against the same Linear ticket. The API server eventually
        received three completion notifications and had to reconcile
        conflicting outputs.
      </p>

      <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The debugging session was a nightmare. Each worker&rsquo;s SQLite had
        a different timeline. The API server had a fourth timeline. We had to
        manually reconstruct which worker did what when, cross-referencing
        container logs with database timestamps that weren&rsquo;t synchronized.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-zinc-900 mt-12 mb-4">
        The Rule: Six Paths, Two Patterns, Zero Exceptions
      </h2>

      <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        We made a decision immediately after that incident: worker containers
        may not import database modules, ever. Not for caching. Not for
        temporary state. Not for &ldquo;just this one query.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        We codified this in three layers:
      </p>

      <ul className="space-y-2 text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed pl-6 list-disc mb-6">
        <li>
          <strong>Architectural:</strong> Workers are stateless executors. The
          API server is the sole owner of state.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>API design:</strong> Every worker action that previously
          touched the database now goes through HTTP endpoints.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Enforcement:</strong> A bash script that runs in CI and fails
          the build on any violation.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The forbidden zones in our worker codebase:
      </p>

      <ul className="space-y-2 text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed pl-6 list-disc mb-6">
        <li>
          <code>src/commands/</code>&mdash;CLI commands that trigger agent
          actions
        </li>
        <li>

          <code>src/claude.ts</code>&mdash;Claude-specific integration and
          response parsing
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The two forbidden import patterns:
      </p>

      <ul className="space-y-2 text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed pl-6 list-disc mb-6">
        <li>
          <code>from &lsquo;be/db&rsquo;</code>&mdash;our database query layer

        <li>
          <code>bun:sqlite</code>&mdash;the raw SQLite driver
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Pattern-based detection beats type-based enforcement because it&rsquo;s
        trivial to verify and impossible to circumvent through type gymnastics.
        You either import the module or you don&rsquo;t.

        are just CPUs that execute instructions. They don&rsquo;t have memory.
        They don&rsquo;t have state. They don&rsquo;t have opinions about what
        &ldquo;should&rdquo; be happening.

        The Ripple Effect: What Statelessness Unlocked
      </h2>

      <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Once workers became stateless, three things became trivial:
      </p>

      <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Horizontal scaling became a non-event.</strong> Any container
        can handle any task because they&rsquo;re identical. No sticky
        sessions. No data migration. No &ldquo;warmup&rdquo; containers that
        have cached state. We scale by adding containers to a pool. The API
        server&rsquo;s task queue handles distribution.
      </p>

      <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Workers became ephemeral.</strong> We run worker containers as
        Docker images that get killed and recreated constantly. A worker that
        crashes mid-task simply&hellip; stops. Its replacement pulls the same
        task from the queue and continues. No state to preserve. No
        &ldquo;graceful shutdown&rdquo; handler that might fail.
      </p>

      <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>API design became rigorous.</strong> When you can&rsquo;t take
        shortcuts through the database, every data access pattern needs a
        proper API endpoint. This forced us to design clean boundaries between
        concerns. The API server is now a well-documented service with
        explicit contracts. Workers are dumb clients that don&rsquo;t need to
        understand database schemas.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-zinc-900 mt-12 mb-4">
        What We Tried That Didn&rsquo;t Work
      </h2>

      <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Before settling on the bash script, we experimented with softer
        enforcement:
      </p>

      <ul className="space-y-2 text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed pl-6 list-disc mb-6">
        <li>
          <strong>Code review checklists:</strong> forgotten under deadline
          pressure. Reviewers don&rsquo;t catch violations in 400-line PRs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>ESLint rules with custom plugins:</strong> bypassed with{" "}
          <code>// eslint-disable</code>. The escape hatch becomes the default
          during crunch.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Runtime detection:</strong> checking imports at worker
          startup. This catches violations late&mdash;after deployment, when
          the build already passed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Architecture Decision Records:</strong> great for onboarding,
          useless for enforcement. Developers don&rsquo;t re-read ADRs before
          submitting PRs.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The bash script won because it&rsquo;s the only option with zero escape
        hatches. You cannot bypass a grep. You cannot negotiate with a failing
        CI check at 2 AM when you need to ship a hotfix.
      </p>

        The Pattern: Apply This to Any Agent System
      </h2>

      <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        You don&rsquo;t need our exact stack to use this pattern. The general
        form is:
      </p>

      <ol className="space-y-2 text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed pl-6 list-decimal mb-6">
        <li>
          Identify your <strong>orchestrator</strong> (owns state) and{" "}
          <strong>workers</strong> (execute tasks)
        </li>
        <li>
          Define the boundary&mdash;which modules/paths workers may not access
        </li>
        <li>Write a dumb script that greps for violations</li>
        <li>Make it a merge gate in CI</li>
        <li>Replace direct state access with HTTP/queue messages</li>
      </ol>

      <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The enforcement mechanism matters more than the specific technology.
        Discipline degrades under deadline pressure; bash scripts don&rsquo;t.

        The Prediction: Where Agent Frameworks Are Heading
      </h2>

      <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Within 12 months, every mature agent framework will ship with a default
        &ldquo;workers must not access shared state directly&rdquo; invariant.
        The alternative is debugging race conditions that surface as
        &ldquo;flaky agent behavior&rdquo; weeks after deployment.
      </p>

      <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Teams running 10+ concurrent agents who give each worker database
        access are quietly racking up state divergence bugs. They manifest as:
      </p>

      <ul className="space-y-2 text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed pl-6 list-disc mb-6">
        <li>
          Agents that &ldquo;forget&rdquo; constraints mentioned in previous
          turns
        </li>
        <li>Tasks marked complete by one agent and pending by another</li>
        <li>Duplicate actions executed by different workers</li>
        <li>
          Intermittent failures that can&rsquo;t be reproduced with
          single-worker testing
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        These aren&rsquo;t flaky agents. They&rsquo;re distributed systems bugs
        wearing agent costumes. The fix isn&rsquo;t better prompting&mdash;it&rsquo;s
        architectural separation enforced with tooling.

        When Should You Add This Rule?

        <div className="text-[14px] text-amber-900 leading-relaxed">
          Not when you hit 10 workers. Not when you first see a race condition.
          Add it when you have two workers and are tempted to give them SQLite
          for &ldquo;fast memory.&rdquo; That temptation is the warning sign.
          The cost of fixing state divergence grows quadratically with worker
          count. Fix it at two workers, not twenty.

        <div className="text-[14px] text-amber-900 leading-relaxed">
          This is the most common resistance we hear. Embedding caches are the
          gateway drug to local state. Use Redis with a shared instance, or
          call an embedding API with caching at the API server level. The 50ms
          you save isn&rsquo;t worth the distributed systems headache
          you&rsquo;re creating. Cache invalidation across local SQLite
          instances is the problem you&rsquo;re avoiding by avoiding the cache
          entirely.

      </h2>

      <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Every architectural decision in our agent swarm traces back to that
        30-line bash script. Stateless workers. Ephemeral containers. Clean
        API boundaries. Horizontal scaling without config changes. Debugging
        via single timeline replay.
      </p>

      <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The script isn&rsquo;t clever. It&rsquo;s not even elegant. But
        it&rsquo;s the invariant that holds everything together, and it will
        outlast every engineer on the team. That&rsquo;s the point.
        Architectural boundaries enforced with tooling survive team turnover,
        late-night refactors, and &ldquo;just this once&rdquo; shortcuts.
      </p>

      <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Your agent swarm will face the same temptation. The question is
        whether you&rsquo;ll enforce the boundary before the incident, or
        after.
