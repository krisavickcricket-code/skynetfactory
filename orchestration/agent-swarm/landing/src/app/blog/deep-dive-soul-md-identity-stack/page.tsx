      <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        We killed our first agent swarm with kindness. Too many prompt engineers, too many
        &quot;quick tweaks&quot; to system prompts, and zero memory of what worked yesterday.
        Every container restart was amnesia. The Coder agent would commit the same anti-pattern
        three days in a row. The Researcher would forget which APIs rate-limited aggressively.
        We were running a dementia ward in Kubernetes.
      </p>

      <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The problem: we treated agents as stateless functions when they&apos;re actually
        long-term colleagues. You don&apos;t reintroduce yourself to your coworker every
        morning. So we built the 4-File Identity Stack &mdash; a persistent, versioned,
        self-evolving identity system that survives restarts, learns from mistakes, and allows
        lead agents to coach their workers through structured identity updates.
      </p>

            It would stop repeating mistakes, refine its working style, and accumulate domain
            expertise that survives container restarts &mdash; transforming from a tool into a
            team member.

        </div>

        <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          The blank slate problem is everywhere. You spin up an agent with a 4,000-token system
          prompt stuffed with generic best practices. It does okay. Next session, same prompt,
          same results. No memory of the time it tried to use that deprecated endpoint. No
          record that it works better with smaller PRs. No evolution.

          truncated, IDENTITY.md gets truncated only if absolutely necessary, TOOLS.md is
          context-window aware, and CLAUDE.md is disposable. This ensures your Coder agent never
          forgets it&apos;s test-first, even when juggling a massive codebase.

        </div>

        <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Self-evolution happens at the tool layer. When the Coder agent submits a PR and gets
          feedback that it&apos;s too large, the PostToolUse hook fires. The agent analyzes the
          delta between intended and actual outcome, then proposes an edit to its own SOUL.md:
          &quot;Prefer PRs under 400 lines changed. Decompose large features into stacked
          PRs.&quot;
        </p>

        <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          This isn&apos;t just appending text. The agent uses structured editing to maintain
          SOUL.md integrity, avoiding duplicate directives and updating confidence scores on
          existing preferences.

        <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          The Lead agent doesn&apos;t just delegate &mdash; it mentors. When the Lead notices
          the Coder consistently skipping tests, it doesn&apos;t just nag. It updates the
          Coder&apos;s SOUL.md directly, appending a directive: &quot;Test-first development is
          non-negotiable. Run test suite before PR submission.&quot;
        </p>

        <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Every coaching update includes version metadata: who changed it (Lead-1), when (ISO
          timestamp), and why (&quot;observed 3 PRs without tests in last 24h&quot;). This
          creates an audit trail of personality drift. You can see exactly when your Coder became
          obsessive about types, or when your Researcher developed its preference for REST over
          GraphQL.

        <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Identity files live in three places: the workspace (for the agent to read/write), the
          database (single source of truth), and the vector store (for semantic search across the
          swarm). Keeping these in sync is where most implementations fail.
        </p>

        <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          We use a bidirectional sync with conflict resolution:

              "Conflict Resolution:",
              "If Lead and Worker edit SOUL.md simultaneously, both versions are preserved with conflict markers. The agent reconciles on next startup using the LLM to merge semantic intent.",

          This survives container restarts because the DB persists. An agent can crash mid-edit,

          But crucially, these are starting points, not cages. The Coder template begins with
          general best practices. After 30 days in your specific repo, that Coder&apos;s SOUL.md
          has evolved to reflect your codebase&apos;s quirks &mdash; maybe it learned you prefer
          functional React, or that your backend requires specific error handling patterns. No

          Compare this to teams maintaining monolithic system prompts. They&apos;re editing JSON
          files, redeploying services, and hoping the new prompt doesn&apos;t break other
          behaviors. Our approach required zero manual prompt engineering after day one. The agent
          self-tuned to the codebase.

          Stateless agents are a dead end. If you want AI teammates rather than AI tools, you
          need persistence, evolution, and coaching. The 4-File Identity Stack &mdash; SOUL.md,
          IDENTITY.md, TOOLS.md, and CLAUDE.md &mdash; gives you a practical architecture for
          building agents that get better with age.
        </p>

        <p className="text-[15px] text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Start with a template. Let your agents edit themselves. Coach them when they&apos;re
          wrong. And stop treating every restart as a new hire. Your agents should remember the
          last war, not just the current battle.
